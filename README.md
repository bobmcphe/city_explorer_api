## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

City Explorer aims to provide easy access to useful information by a simple search function. The user inputs the name of a chosen city, and receives various detailed information relevant to the search query (e.g. weather, local restaurants, etc.).

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

City Explorer uses a node server to access API's to fetch data that is input from the client side, via an input form, which the said data is then formatted and attached through mustache templating, which is accessed via a CDN. 

## Change Log
